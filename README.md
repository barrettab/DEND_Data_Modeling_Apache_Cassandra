# DEND_Data_Modeling_Apache_Cassandra (Udacity DEND)

## Project Summary
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

## How to Use
Run the Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb file to create the DB, tables, and run the sample queries.
